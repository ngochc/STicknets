# Spread-learned spatial features to improve tick-shape networks

## Abstract

The rapid growth of mobile devices and embedded systems requires lightweight networks with high performance in reasonable complexity. Recently, TickNets have been proposed to meet that requirement via connecting several tick-shape backbones. However, their performance is still at modest levels due to the lack of spatial features exploited from a basic tick-shape backbone. To mitigate this problem, an efficient perceptron is proposed to take into account spread-learned spatial features for improving the learning ability of tick-shape networks. Accordingly, this spread-learned feature extractor is simply done by adding a Full Residual Point-Depth-Point (FR-PDP) block to the beginning of a basic backbone. Such a strategy will ensure two practical benefits for the tick-shape networks: i) Exploiting the identical FR-PDP-based features in a tick-shape backbone; and ii) Extracting more discriminative spatial features for the learning process. Finally, STickNets are formed by simply connecting several spread-learned tick-shape backbones. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets have indicated that our proposal has significantly boosted the performance of tick-shape networks. In particular, STickNet-basic is enhanced by âˆ¼3.5% on CIFAR100, up to 7.4% on Stanford Dogs. 

## Installation

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3.10. The project uses `.tool-versions` to specify the Python version.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Python 3.10**
   ```bash
   # If using asdf (recommended)
   asdf install python 3.10.14
   asdf local python 3.10.14
   
   # Or download from python.org
   # https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31014/
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # On Windows:
   # venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Upgrade pip
   pip install --upgrade pip
   
   # Install requirements
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   # Check Python version
   python --version
   
   # Should output: Python 3.10.14
   ```

### Development Setup

For development, you may want to install additional tools:

```bash
# Install development dependencies (if any)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # if exists

# Install pre-commit hooks (if configured)
pre-commit install
```

## Usage

### Training with S_TickNet_Dogs.py

The `S_TickNet_Dogs.py` script trains a Spatial TickNet model on the Stanford Dogs dataset. Here are some example usage patterns:

#### Basic Training
```bash
# Train with default settings (Stanford Dogs dataset)
python S_TickNet_Dogs.py

# Train with custom data path
python S_TickNet_Dogs.py --data-root /path/to/StanfordDogs

# Train with specific architecture type
python S_TickNet_Dogs.py --architecture-types basic
```

#### Advanced Training Options
```bash
# Train with custom hyperparameters
python S_TickNet_Dogs.py \
    --batch-size 32 \
    --epochs 100 \
    --learning-rate 0.01 \
    --gpu-id 0 \
    --workers 8

# Train with learning rate scheduling
python S_TickNet_Dogs.py \
    --learning-rate 0.1 \
    --schedule 50 75 90 \
    --epochs 100

# Train with different architecture configurations
python S_TickNet_Dogs.py \
    --architecture-types basic \
    --config 0
```

#### Evaluation Mode
```bash
# Evaluate a trained model
python S_TickNet_Dogs.py --evaluate
```

#### Dataset Options
```bash
# Download dataset automatically
python S_TickNet_Dogs.py --download

# Use different datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Stanford Dogs)
python S_TickNet_Dogs.py --dataset cifar10
python S_TickNet_Dogs.py --dataset cifar100
python S_TickNet_Dogs.py --dataset dogs  # default
```
